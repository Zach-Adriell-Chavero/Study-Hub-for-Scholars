# Study Hub for Scholars

## Description
Scholars struggle with studying, so my project proposal is aimed to create easily accessable notes for everyone to use.

This application will center around two file types: Folders and notes.

Notes are the center of attention. They are here to be shared and used for the purpose of studying. Furthermore, we will be including a formatting feature to better organize notes.
Folders contain notes, and is there to help organization. Folder owners can also share their notes by allowing it to be viewed, commented, and edited.
Also, you cannot access or share folders without an account. Blacklisting is when you can unable a person to view or edit a folder, because of griefing. It would be unfair for guest accounts to edit or view folders, because blacklisting becomes extremely complicated.

## Features
All of the followings are features that are guranteed to be added during the next major update.
- The ability to create notes and folders.
- Proper note formatting (e.g. headings, bolding, lists)
- Account creation
- Folder sharing
- Folder blacklisting

## How to Run the Program
1. Download the file `study_hub.exe`.
2. Open the application.
3. Create an account.
